# Functional Correctness via Model-based Testing

This is an experiment with using model-based testing as the primary testing method on an application. The actual application is a simple one for tracking recurring bills with different recurrence rules (think monthly, biweekly, etc.).

A specific type of model-based testing is used here, where a reference model is built in the same language as the client-side state manager. Some design choices are made to make this simpler, such as using MobX to make that state manager observable and have state changes automatically rendered in the UI.

# Setup

Start the web server:

```
cd rails_api
rails s
```

In a new terminal tab, start the frontend:

```
cd react_ui
npm start
```

# Testing

Start the web server in the test environment:

```
cd rails_api
RAILS_ENV=test rails s
```

Run the model-based test command:

```
./test
```

There are also some specific test cases that can be run with:

```
./testexamples
```
